## What is Snaplet Generate?

Snaplet `generate` is a powerful tool for seeding your database with data that mimics real-world scenarios. It leverages your database schema to generate data that respects the relationships and constraints defined within your schema.

## Examples

Each example in this directory demonstrates a unique use case of the `generate` feature, ranging from simple data seeding to more complex scenarios involving data relationships and constraints.

### How to Use

1. **Define Your Database Schema**: Before generating data, ensure your database schema is defined and reflects the relationships between different data entities.
2. **Create a Data Generation Plan**: Translate your requirements into a data generation plan within the Snaplet configuration.
3. **Run the Generate Command**: Use `snaplet generate` to populate your database with the generated data.
