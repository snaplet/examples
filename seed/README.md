# Snaplet seed Examples

This directory contains examples showcasing the use of Snaplet's `seed` feature. Snaplet `seed` helps create realistic, production-like data for your development databases, facilitating efficient and practical testing and development.

## What is Snaplet seed?

Snaplet `seed` is a powerful tool for seeding your database with data that mimics real-world scenarios. It leverages your database schema to seed data that respects the relationships and constraints defined within your schema.

## Examples

Each example in this directory demonstrates a unique use case of the `seed` feature, ranging from simple data seeding to more complex scenarios involving data relationships and constraints.

### How to Use

1. **Define Your Database Schema**: Before generating data, ensure your database schema is defined and reflects the relationships between different data entities.
2. **Create a Data Generation Plan**: Translate your requirements into a data generation plan within the Snaplet configuration.
3. **Run the seed script**: Use `@snaplet/seed` to generate a seed script to populate your database with the seedd data.

For more detailed instructions, refer to the README within each example directory.
